## ‚ú® What it does

This script automates sending a birthday wish to someone via the **WhatsApp Desktop App** on Windows, using **PyAutoGUI** for automation and **Task Scheduler** to run the script automatically at 12 am.


## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- A Windows machine (updates for Linux coming soon)
- Python installed on your system (3.8 or higher recommended).
- WhatsApp Desktop App installed on your Windows machine.
- A comfortable sleep schedule


## üìù Requirements

### Python Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The script uses the following libraries:
- **pyautogui** (for desktop automation)
- **time** (for time manipulation and delays)

   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   CONTACT_NAME = "Recipient's Name"
   MESSAGE = f"Wish you a very Happy Birthday dear {CONTACT_NAME}!!"
   ```
   > **Note: Ensure the contact name matches exactly how it appears in your WhatsApp Desktop.**

<br/>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Test the Script

### Steps:

1. **Open Task Scheduler**  
   - Press `Win + S` and search for **Task Scheduler**.


2. **Create a Basic Task**  
   - Click on **Create Basic Task**.  
   - Name the task (e.g., `WhatsAppBirthdayAutomation`) and provide a short description.
   

3. **Set Trigger**  
   Choose **One Time** and set the start time to **12:00 AM** on the **day before the birthday**.


4. **Set Action**  
   - Select **Start a Program**.  
   - Fill in the following details:  

   - **Program/script:**  
     ```  
     C:\[path to venv]\Scripts\python.exe  
     ```  

   - **Add arguments:**  
     ```  
     C:\[path to theFirstMinute]\script.py  
     ```  

   - **Start in:**  
     ```  
     C:\[path to theFirstMinute]
     ```  


5. **Finish and Test**  
   - Save the task.  
   - Run the task manually in **Task Scheduler** to confirm it works.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. Opens the WhatsApp Desktop App using Windows Search.
2. Searches for the specified contact.
3. Sends the birthday message to the contact.
4. Allows you to sleep peacefully while the task is done automatically.


## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If the script doesn't run as expected, it could possibly be due to:

1. If the script doesn‚Äôt click the right spots, recalibrate the screen coordinates or resolution scaling.
2. Make sure your screen resolution matches or adjust BASE_WIDTH and BASE_HEIGHT in the script.
3. Ensure WhatsApp Desktop is properly installed and linked to your account.
